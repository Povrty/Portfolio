      <p class="seen">Hey I'm Ian and I'm 15.  I started coding when I was in 6th grade.  I joined my school's coding club and absolutely hated it.  I thought it was really boring and</p>
      <p class="hidden">never really understood what I was doing. From that experience, coding was something I had 0 interest in.  Fast forward to the summer after 6th grade.  We were suppose to take a break from playing video gamesI lied about playing games so my punishment was...learning coding.  I never was interested in code until the start of 9th grade.</p>
